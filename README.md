# Project 7: Checklist – se_project_aroundtheus

## 📋 Project Description
This project is an interactive web application called **Checklist**, part of the _se_project_aroundtheus_ assignment. It allows users to manage two types of content:

- A card-based photo gallery showcasing scenic places.

Users can edit their profile, add new places to the gallery with titles and image links, and interact with dynamic elements such as popups and form validation. This project emphasizes modular JavaScript structure, DOM manipulation, form validation, and dynamic rendering of components.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Techniques Used
